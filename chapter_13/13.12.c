/*Create a text file consisting of 20 rows of 30 integers. The integers should be in the range 
0â€“9 and be separated by spaces. The file is a digital representation of a picture, with 
the values 0 through 9 representing increasing levels of darkness. Write a program that 
reads the contents of the file into a 20-by-30 array of int s. In a crude approach toward 
converting this digital representation to a picture, have the program use the values 
in this array to initialize a 20-by-31 array of char s, with a 0 value corresponding to a 
space character, a 1 value to the period character, and so on, with each larger number 
represented by a character that occupies more space. For example, you might use  #  to 
represent 9. The last character (the 31st) in each row should be a null character, making 
it an array of 20 strings. Have the program display the resulting picture (that is, print the 
strings) and also store the result in a text file. For example, suppose you start with this 
data:*/

#include <stdio.h>

#include <string.h>

#define COLS 30

	if ((file2 = fopen("s", "w")) == NULL) {

	}
	for (i = 0; i < ROWS; ++i) {
		for (j = 0; j < COLS; ++j) {
